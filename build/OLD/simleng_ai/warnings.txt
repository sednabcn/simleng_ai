Suppress Specific Warnings In Python

Further, let’s see how to suppress specific warnings in Python using the warnings package. For stopping particular signs, we will need to add another parameter in the ‘filterwarnings()’ function, i.e., category.

    import warnings
    Use the ‘filterwarnings()’ function to ignore all warnings by setting ‘ignore’ as a parameter. In addition to that, add a parameter ‘category’ and specify the type of warning.

1
2
	
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning) # setting ignore as a parameter and further adding category

Similarly, you can add any category you desire and suppress those warnings.
Suppressing Pandas warnings

You can even suppress pandas warnings in order to do that. You have to write a code to suppress warnings before importing pandas.

import warnings
warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning) # setting ignore as a parameter and further adding category
 
import pandas
Suppressing Warnings In Tensorflow

Further, you can even ignore tensorflow warnings if you want. The way to ignore warnings in tensorflow is a bit different. Let’s understand step by step:

    For TF 2.x, you can use the following code

1
	
tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)

    For TF 1.x, you can use the following code

1
	
tf.compat.v1.logging.set_verbosity(tf.compat.v1.logging.ERROR)

The codes mentioned above are used to remove logging information. Therefore any messages will not be printed. Further, if you want to remove deprecated warnings or future warnings in TF 1. x, you can use:
1
2
	
from tensorflow.python.util import deprecation
deprecation._PRINT_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS = False

To suppress futurewarnings along with current deprecated warnings, use:
1
2
3
	
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=FutureWarning)
Suppress Warnings in Python IDE (Pycharm)

When you use an IDE like Pycharm, you can disable inspections, so no warnings are raised. Moreover, you can also suppress a warning for a particular line of code.

    Disable warnings for a particular line of code.

1
	
from application import routes  # noqa

By commenting ‘noqa,’ you can suppress warnings for that single line of code. In addition to that, if you want to suppress all warnings, you can follow these given steps:

    Go to Settings dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S) and select Editor/Inspections.
    And then go to the inspection you want to disable, further uncheck the checkbox next to it.
    Apply the changes and close the dialog box.

Suppress Pylint Warnings

To disable pylint warnings, you can also use the symbolic identities of warnings rather than memorize all the code numbers, for example:
1
	
# pylint: disable=locally-disabled, multiple-statements, fixme, line-too-long

You can use this comment to disable any warnings for that line, and it will apply to the code that is coming after it. Similarly, it can be used after an end of a line for which it is meant.

Disable Warnings In Jupyter Notebook

You can suppress all warnings in the jupyter notebook by using the warnings module and using functions like ‘simplefilter()’ and ‘filterwarnings()’.
1

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
warnings.simplefilter('ignore')

Further, to suppress warnings for a particular line of codes, you can use :
1

import warnings
 
def warning_function():
    warnings.warn("deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
 
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
    warning_function() #now warnings will be suppressed 
Disable Warning While Ansible Execution

You can disable all the warnings when using ansible by making the deprecation_warnings = ‘false’ in defaults section of your effective configuration file i.e.(/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, ~/.ansible.cfg).
Suppress Matplotlib Warnings

To suppress the matplotlib library, first import all required modules in addition to that import warnings module. Further use the’ filterwarnings()’ function to disable the warnings.
1
2
3
4
	
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

Then finish writing your remaining code, you will see no warnings pop up, and the code will be executed.
Disable SSL Warnings Python Requests

Further, let’s see how you can disable security certificate checks for requests in Python.

When we use the requests module, we pass ‘verify = False’ along with the URL, which disables the security checks.

5
	
import requests
   
# sending a get http request to specified link URL
response = requests.request(
    "GET", "https://www.yoururlhere.com", verify=False)

Bypassing the ‘verify=False,’ you can make the program execute without errors.

Conclusion

In this article, we have seen how we can suppress warnings when needed, although warnings are essential as they can signify a problem you might leave unseen. Therefore it is advised to code with warnings enabled. Only disable them when it is of utmost importance to ignore them.
